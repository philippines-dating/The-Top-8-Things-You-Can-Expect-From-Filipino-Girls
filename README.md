# The Top 8 Things You Can Expect From Filipino Girls

There's no doubting foreign men love Philippines girls, once they've been discovered.

You don't know what you don't know, right? Filipino women are one of those undiscovered mysteries in life but they are certainly a bonus to enquiring men.

Which is why once a foreigner gets a taste for Pinay girls, they rarely go back to that boring life with Western women.

So here my Top 8 (and sometimes quirky) expectations on Filipino girls:-

## You Will Eat Til You Drop!

[Food is a huge and important part](https://pinayromances.com/blog/what-are-the-top-10-filipino-breakfasts-i-must-try) of the culture in the Philippines.

Young children learn from an early age how to cook amazing meals and girls understand one way to a man's heart is definitely through his stomach.

One of the first things you'll learn about [dating a Filipina](https://pinayromances.com/blog/how-to-find-a-philippines-girl-the-safe-and-right-way), is that they love to eat. Seriously!

Some of the best meals I've had in my life, have been with Filipino girlfriends who have always wanted to home cook for me. A home cooked meal demonstrates to a potential boyfriend (or husband) that the girl is serious.

Don't believe this is a big deal?

Think about the girls back home then.

They can barely throw together a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and that's only if they could be bothered which most aren't.

But, every Filipino girl that I've ever known could cook an entire meal from scratch. And she actually wants to do it.

My advice? When you're dating a Pinay girl, focus any (if not, all) your dating activities around food and you'll be cleared for many pleasures afterwards.

## Expect To Spend Lots Of Time With Her Friends

Close and dear friendships is highly regarded in the Philippines.

Philippines women usually have a large circle of buddies who are all close to everything she does, including foreign boyfriends - that's you.

Given her pre-disposition to her friends, she will want to take you everywhere, with her friends included. This is a clear sign she likes you too.

But a strong word of warning, for you. Keep your eyes from wandering to looks at her friends. Filipina women are extremely jealous and will flame-on at the first hint of a man's wandering eyes.

Her friends will be included in everything. If you have any resistance to that, it will be seen as a major negative, in her mind. She wants to include you. Plus, she wants you to like her friends (and vice versa).

## Philippines Family Time

Just as Filipino girls have a deep love of cooking, this is a reflection of her even deeper love for her family.

While you may or may not like the group-date thing, with her friends tagging along, you will need to spend a good deal of time with the girl's family.

If you like them, and they like you, chances are high that many outings with her will also be spent with her family.

Family gatherings will be common, in the Philippines. You can expect many family meals together. Food is what bonds families together, and if the [relationship is serious](https://pinayromances.com/blog/4-surprising-benefits-of-relationship-with-filipina), you're going to get to know her family, very quickly.

Different to western culture, meeting a Pinay's family happens early in the relationship. If you don't botch it with her friends, she will introduce you to her family relatively quickly. Get ready, get set, GO!

## There Will Be Arguments.

As I mentioned earlier, Filipinas can be a little feisty, at times.

This is to be expected when you're dating a woman of any nationality, but it's going to be amplified when you're dating a Pinay women - they are opinionated and strong girls.

It's rare they'll back down in an argument. Hold true, stand your ground and let her who is the boss and why she needs to 'calm the hell down or else'. Don't be pussy-whipped.

On the good side though, arguments with your Filipina girlfriend will be short, vigorous, and to the point. She won't hold a grudge afterwards which is the perfect opportunity for make-up sex.

## Pinay Girls Love to Love

Women from the Philippines are truly kind and thoughtful.

They cherish the feeling of love, and they give far more than what they get.

You should never feel smothered by this bombardment of feelings though.

A Pinay doesn't want to clingy.

She is showing her true unadulterated feelings to you. This is her natural state of being. It's also a demonstration of what she wants from you too.

I'll make a good note here too - Philippines girls are easy to love. Kindness, warmth and copious amounts of lovemaking all combined into a very cute package. What's not to love?

## Commitment, Always

All women in the Philippines will be committed to a healthy long-term relationship when they get the opportunity for one.

Seldom will a Filipina prolong a relationship which isn't going anywhere, for them.

Eventually, you will be asked point-blank where the relationship is going.

If you are dating a Filipina who is seriously looking for 'long term', don't expect a casual relationship to last very long if you only want short-term sex and many women. She'll end things if you do.

The upside, obviously, is this situation plays into your hands with her ending things so you actually can move on, without too much drama.

## Filipina Girls Are Cheap To Keep Happy

Since the Philippines is a poor country, Filipino people tend to be frugal by nature. They are used to cheap entertainment and happy times.

Filipino women are far less materialistic than Western women.

Filipino people make due with very little, in the Philippines.

Just being a good guy who will be there for your Filipina girlfriend, is all she needs to feel safe and happy.

Feed her good (and cheap) delicious local food and you've won your prize.

## Boundless Amount of Boom-Boom

Is it quirky that a devoutly religious slim attractive brown-skinned and cute girl from the Philippines will jump your bones so quick?

Yes is the answer.

Women in the Philippines have no hang-ups when it comes to the natural duty of being a woman when it comes to sexual requirements.

Dating a Filipina comes with her commitment in providing quality sexual encounters, providing you fulfil your side of the arrangement.

You can fully expect to always [get laid in the Philippines](https://pinayromances.com/blog/how-do-i-get-laid-in-the-philippines), if your act appropriately. Entertain her, relax with her, meet her family (and friends) and go slow and rock hard.

You will not be disappointed.

## Closing

You will have some quirky encounters with Filipina (or Pinay) but most are perfectly normal when you're dating in another country.

[Dating a Filipino girl](https://pinayromances.com/) will be one of the best experiences of your life. Be respectful, make an effort to enjoy her, and be there for her.
